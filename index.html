            AngularJS is built around the belief that declarative programming should be used for building user
            interfaces and connecting software components, while imperative programming is better suited to defining an
            application's business logic.[2] The framework adapts and extends traditional HTML to present dynamic
            content through two-way data-binding that allows for the automatic synchronization of models and views. As a
            result, AngularJS de-emphasizes explicit DOM manipulation with the goal of improving testability and
            performance.
